# Bakeoof

Created for the UCF CS 8 Hour Baking Themed Hackathon.

Bakeoof generates a absurd random cake, cookie, or muffin themed recipe with directions specific to each.

Data is generated from a dataset of recipes and ingredients to craft each generated recipe.

The images are pulled from the Bing image search API using the generated title.

Built with Go and Angular.
